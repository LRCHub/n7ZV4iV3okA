[00:19.67] Party lights fade away on weekend
[00:27.67] I say "See you again" to my friend
[00:33.64] "Hurt again...!"
[00:41.64] 
[00:35.77] I feel lonely when I think I can't see you
[00:44.27] my beloved one..."Prince Charming"
[01:01.27] 
[00:49.18] I won't forget our time we spent
[00:54.73] Yeah... I'll miss you
[00:59.03] "Is this feeling love?"
[01:10.53] 
[01:02.78] Everything is coming to the end
[01:06.96] Joyful time with you "slipped in a flash"
[01:10.93] When I close my eyes I dream of you
[01:14.37] I drop tears "Is this feeling love?"
[01:32.37] 
[01:18.72] Everything is coming to the end
[01:22.66] I know this isn't my last chance
[01:26.40] But I can't say my feeling
[01:28.37] ...It's "I love you"
[01:30.63] Oh... I can't say!
[01:32.86] You are with her... Baby "Right?"
[01:49.36] 
[01:46.16] Yes, I don't mind becoming Devil
[01:53.91] If I can have your heart but maybe will
[02:00.09] ...not be in full bloom "Help me!"
[02:07.13] I'm in Unlucky love mood...
[02:20.63] 
[02:13.62] Everything is came to the end
[02:17.78] I wasn't ready to fall in love
[02:21.52] but now I'm crazy about you, oh baby
[02:25.43] I'm thinking of you day and night
[02:41.93] 
[02:29.54] Everything is came to the end
[02:33.23] I'm looking up to the magic stars
[02:37.29] not to drop tears
[02:39.09] Now I'm in love with you, Because
[02:43.00] You're so Romantic and so sweet...
[03:00.00] 
[02:55.16] Yes, I don't mind becoming Devil
[03:10.96] I want your heart (I want your heart)
[03:29.46] 
[03:32.23] Everything is came to the end
[03:36.04] Joyful time with you "slipped in a flash"
[03:40.44] When I close my eyes I dream of you
[03:44.02] I drop tears "Is this feeling love?"
[04:02.02] 
[03:48.17] Everything is came to the end
[03:52.48] I know this isn't my last chance
[03:56.20] But, I can't say my feeling
[03:58.24] ...It's "I love you"
[04:00.20] Thinking of you day and night
[04:14.70] 
[04:03.87] "Prince Charming"
[04:05.56] I'm in love with you, Because
[04:08.17] You're so Romantic and so sweet...
